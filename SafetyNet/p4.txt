times, workers had to physically go to an unemployment
office to file for unemployment benefits. Today, workers
can file most everything via cell phone and/or the internet.

Conclusion

The innovative plan for UI in the United States was first
tried individually by a few states. FUTA made it a federal-
state partnership. And UI programs have changed accord-
ing to economic conditions, individual states, unemploy-
ment rates, and federal intervention. But some things
have remained constant: The UI system helps eligible
workers who have lost their jobs by temporarily replacing
part of their wages. The benefits are especially important
during economic downturns and recessions. For example,
during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment
rate spiked sharply, but workers could apply for unemploy-
ment benefits. Unlike the days of the Great Depression,
workers today have some protection from unemploy-
ment. The federal-state unemployment insurance pro-
gram continues to serve its intended purpose with reason-
able results. Ul has been tried and has remained true to
the hopes and ideas of the founders of FUTA. =
