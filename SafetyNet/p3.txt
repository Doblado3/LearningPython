rate is the same for all employers in all states. However,
the state employment tax varies from one state to
another.

Employers must pay FUTA tax on a regular basis. And at
the end of a year, employers must file a FUTA tax return.
This tax return requires filers to record FUTA tax payments
made for the year and submit any payment due. FUTA
taxes are submitted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
and are credited to individual state accounts.

As part of the federal-state partnership, the federal gov-
ernment pays for administrative costs and for setting up
employment offices that attempt to match workers with
new jobs.'6 Determining benefits and issuing payments
are state responsibilities.

Data Collection

Data collected by the DOL from state unemployment
agencies for the number of UI claims filed weekly are help-
ful. These data can tell something about the job market.
For example, when the number of initial claims is steep,
it’s an indication of an abrupt loss of jobs (Figure 3). Con-
tinued claims (Figure 4) indicate the number of unem-
ployed people who have already filed an initial claim and
are filing again so that they keep receiving weekly benefits.

However, many workers who lose their job may not file
for UC for a while. And many people remain unemployed
after benefits expire. So, UI claims data do not precisely
show the number of unemployed persons and are not a
measure of the unemployment rate. The unemployment
rate is measured quite differently by another agency,
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS does not
use the unemployment claims data to figure the unem-
ployment rate. It uses a system of household surveys to
collect information from a representative sample of the
U.S. population to calculate the unemployment rate
(Figure 5).

Unemployment Insurance Changes

UI programs are subject to ongoing change. For example,
over the years the duration of regular Ul benefits has
increased from 16 weeks to 26 weeks in most states. Also,
in some previous UI programs, workers could become
eligible for UI after being fired from their job or quitting
work. Over the years this became disallowed in all states.”
Technology has also changed the UI process. In earlier
